**JavaScript Standard Style** automatically lints all open files, then reports errors and warnings in Nova's **Issues** sidebar and the editor gutter.

Even though `standard` treats all rule violations as errors, this extensions (in order to reduce visual clutter) displays auto-fixable issues as "hints" and all other issues as "errors".

## Features

- supported syntaxes: `javascript`, `jsx`, `markdown`, `html`
- `Fix all auto-fixable issues` command that can be invoked through the command palette
- `Auto-fix on save` configurable globally and on a per-workspace basis (off by default)
- uses **locally** installed `standard` only

## Requirements

<!--
ðŸŽˆ If your extension depends on external processes or tools that users will need to have, it's helpful to list those and provide links to their installers:
-->

JavaScript Standard Style requires some additional tools to be installed on your Mac:

A recent [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version that's supported by [standardJS](https://standardjs.com)

> To install the current stable version of Node, click the "Recommended for Most Users" button to begin the download. When that completes, double-click the **.pkg** installer to begin installation.

`standard` has to be installed **locally** in your workspace (e.g. with `npm i -D standard`). This extension will not use any globally installed `standard` installations. If this is something you want, feel free to open an issue or PR.

> If you would like to check additional syntaxes like `markdown` or `html`, you'll need to install the appropriate ESLint plugin. The extension will let you know which one. Additionally, you **must** add the plugin to `standard.plugins` in `package.json` (see https://standardjs.com for more information).

### Configuration

<!--
ðŸŽˆ If your extension offers global- or workspace-scoped preferences, consider pointing users toward those settings. For example:
-->

To configure global preferences, open **Extensions â†’ Extension Library...** then select JavaScript Standard Style's **Preferences** tab.

You can also configure preferences on a per-project basis in **Project â†’ Project Settings...**

**Available options:**

- Enable auto-fix on save (off by default)

<!--
ðŸ‘‹ That's it! Happy developing!
